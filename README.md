# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis

In this data analysis project, I analyzed the dataset of a music store using SQL to answer key business-related questions. The focus was on extracting meaningful insights to help understand the storeâ€™s performance and customer behavior. Key tasks included:

Writing SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate relevant data.
Analyzing sales, customer demographics, and purchasing trends.
Identifying popular genres, artists, and albums contributing to revenue.
Providing data-driven recommendations to improve store operations and marketing strategies.
This project highlights my proficiency in SQL and my ability to leverage data to answer important business questions.
